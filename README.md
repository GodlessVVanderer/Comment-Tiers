# Comment Tiers: On-Page YouTube Comment Analyzer

**Comment Tiers** is an intelligent Chrome extension that integrates directly into the YouTube interface. It adds a simple "Analyze" button that takes the video's comments, filters out spam, and categorizes them into forum-like tiers. This allows you to easily understand the key discussion topics without leaving the video page.

Powered by the Google Gemini API, this extension provides a high-level overview of comment sections, saving you from endlessly scrolling through noise and low-effort replies.

-   **For your YouTube API Key:** In the Google Cloud Console, under "API Restrictions," select "HTTP referrers (web sites)" and add an entry for `https://www.youtube.com/*`.
-   **For your Gemini API Key:** In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to your project and set up "Billing Alerts" to be notified of any unexpected usage.
