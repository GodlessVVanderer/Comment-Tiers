# Comment Tiers: YouTube Comment Categorizer

**Comment Tiers** is an intelligent tool that takes a YouTube video's comments, filters out spam, and categorizes them into forum-like cascading tiers. This allows you to easily browse and understand the discussion topics happening on any video.

Powered by the Google Gemini API, this app provides a high-level overview of comment sections, saving you from endlessly scrolling through noise and low-effort replies.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Intelligent Categorization:** Uses the Gemini API to group comments into relevant topics.
- **Spam & Noise Filtering:** Automatically removes spam, bot comments, and low-effort replies.
- **Usage Control:** Select the maximum number of comments to analyze to balance speed and depth.
- **Multi-language Support:** Detects the primary language of the comments and provides the analysis in your browser's language.
- **Real-time Updates:** See categories appear and populate as the analysis is running.
- **Desktop Notifications:** Get notified when a long analysis is complete.
