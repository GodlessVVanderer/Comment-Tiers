# Comment Tiers: On-Page YouTube Comment Analyzer

**Comment Tiers** is an intelligent Chrome extension that integrates directly into the YouTube interface. It adds a simple "Analyze" button that takes the video's comments, filters out spam, and categorizes them into forum-like tiers. This allows you to easily understand the key discussion topics without leaving the video page.

Powered by the Google Gemini API, this extension provides a high-level overview of comment sections, saving you from endlessly scrolling through noise and low-effort replies.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Seamless On-Page Experience:** An "Analyze" button appears directly on the YouTube video page. No more copy-pasting URLs.
- **Intelligent Categorization:** Uses the Gemini API to group comments into relevant topics.
- **Spam & Noise Filtering:** Automatically removes spam, bot comments, and low-effort replies.
- **Secure Key Storage:** Set your API keys once in the extension's options, and they're stored securely in your browser.
- **Real-time Updates:** See categories appear and populate as the analysis is running.
